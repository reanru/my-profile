                    I graduated in 2021 from Manado State University with a degree in Informatics Engineering. 
                    Since college, Iâ€™ve had a strong interest in web programming and have continued to develop my skills in this area.

                    My career as a web developer began with learning Laravel, along with the basics of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP. 
                    I applied these technologies in several projects, including my final project for graduation.

                    Later on, I started working with React.js in a professional environment, and it has become my primary tool for frontend development to this day. In addition to my full-time work, I also take on small freelance projects and personal side projects to further sharpen my skills and broaden my experience.
